# Sentiment-Analysis
A project which will take various negative or positive movies reviews as input to the model and will try to analyse the sentiment of the reviewer. This has been implemented earlier but i am doing it for leaning purpose. This can be very helpful to the beginner who wants to start with deep learning or machine learning.
